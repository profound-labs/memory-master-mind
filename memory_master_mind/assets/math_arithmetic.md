# Math (Arithmetic)

Calculate the generated expression and type the result.

Use the Preferences menu to customize the challenge.

The 'operations' settings may include __+ - / *__.

If the result is a fraction, the 'solve fractions to decimals' setting controls how many decimal places you are expected to calculate. The value is truncated, not rounded.

13 / 22 = 0.590909091, but if 'solve fractions to decimals' is 1, 0.5 is accepted as a result.
