# Memory Master Mind

This is a command line / terminal app for memory training.

## Statistics / Logging

If you want to save statistics of your progress, turn on 'Save stats' in the app preferences (available from the home menu screen) and provide a path.

The data will be saved in CSV format, so that you can create charts / plots with gnuplot, R, Libreoffice Calc, etc.

Optionally the current challenge settings can be also saved, so that you may filter the rows, e.g. differentiate when memorizing zero-padded digits or not.
