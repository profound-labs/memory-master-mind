"If thou canst not ascend / These steps, die on that marble where thou art.
Thy flesh, near cousin to the common dust, / Will parch for lack of nutriment thy bones
Will wither in few years, and vanish so / That not the quickest eye could find a grain
Of what thou now art on that pavement cold. / The sands of thy short life are spent this hour,
And no hand in the universe can turn / Thy hourglass, if these gummed leaves be burnt / Ere thou canst mount up these immortal steps.

John Keats, The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream"
