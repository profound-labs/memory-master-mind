# Quotes and Verses

Type the hidden words from the quote. Use 'Show answer' if you have never seen the quote before.

Level X hides X percentage of words from the quote, except the author or attribution. At level 5, 50% is hidden, at level 10, the entire quote.

You can supply your own quote selection with the 'Quotes CSV file path' setting in Preferences.

See the example below.

The "..." quote marks wrap one quote, which may include linebreaks and blank lines. To include a `"` in the quote, escape it by doubling, i.e. `"The text was ""tricky"", at best."`

The author or attribution should be either the last line, or wrapped in parentheses `()` at the end. This part is not hidden in the challenge, and can also be used to provide a reminder clue when the entire quote is hidden.

The CSV file only has one column, so there are no separating commas. Blank lines between quotes are ignored.

For reasons to himself best known.

Samuel Butler"
